        Welcome to Le Cin√© Club, the movie app where members are given the
        chance to rate and discuss handpicked movies every month. Members are
        given the chance to test out their skills as a critic, as well as
        participate in thought provoking discussions with like minded
        individuals, or those on the complete opposite side of the spectrum.
